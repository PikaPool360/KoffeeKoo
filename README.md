# Abstract

Every employee likes to begin their day with a cup of coffee as per their preference. The usual procedure is for the cafeteria staff to go around the table and take each person's order on paper before preparing the coffee. 
This process is inefficient and unsustainable. The goal of our project is to provide a platform, or a mobile application for office, cafeteria, and administrative staff to modernize the process of taking order. 

Employees will be able to connect to our KoffeeKo app and enter information about their coffee preferences, while the cafeteria staff will brew the coffee as-per the preferences. This is an eco-friendlier way as it does not utilize paper.

KoffeeKo offers three user interfaces: one for management, one for cafeteria staff, and one for staff members. Employees must first register in the app and give their coffee preferences like light, medium or black. After logging in to the app, it will then display a list of the workers with their coffee preferences so that their order can be processed right away. The admin interface will allow the administration to view the number of employees and cafeteria staff who are registered in the app. Understanding how users interact with our software helps us improve its future optimization. To collaborate on this project, we have utilized GitHub.

We are using Flutter for the front-end part of our app and Firebase for Backend. Firebase is a BaaS (Backend-as-a-Service). We are using the authentication (Email and Password, Google Login) and the cloud storage (Cloud Firestore) services provided by Firebase.
